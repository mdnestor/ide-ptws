This is a solver of integrodifference equations in 1-dimension written in Python 3 used in this paper: [arXiv:2202.00234](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00234). (Tested in Python 3.9.16.)

The main function is given in [ide.py](ide.py) and there are examples of its usage in [/examples/](/examples/). Example 01 is a well-known model while examples 02 and 03 use the model from the paper.
